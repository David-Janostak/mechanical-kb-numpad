My to do list:
 Learning stuff: 
   1) learn to use git in vsc - in progress
   2) learn the basics of C++ - not started yet
   3) make an example keyboard on a breadboard with switches, wires and an ESP32 - done
   4) programm that thing - in progress, currently paused (20.2.25)

 The numpad itself:
   1) choose parts and draw a schematic in EasyEDA
   2) order the pcb and the parts
   3) design and print a case for the pad
   4) assemble it all
   5) programm that thing

Parts list for the numpad:
  1) ESP32 custom low power devboard
  2) brown tactile switches + lube, support switches
  3) custom PCB
  4) zenner diodes for anti-ghosting
  5) battery and it's charging circuit, using ESP32's USB input for charging
  6) (potentially) LED diodes for backlight
  7) numpad keycaps
  8) 3D printed case
