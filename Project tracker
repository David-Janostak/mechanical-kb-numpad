My to do list:
 Learning stuff: 
   1) learn to use git in vsc - in progress
   2) learn the basics of C++ - not started yet
   3) make an example keyboard on a breadboard with switches, wires and an ESP32 - done
   4) programm that thing - in progress, currently paused (20.2.25)

 The numpad itself:
   1) choose parts and draw a schematic in EasyEDA
   2) order the pcb and the parts
   3) design and print a case for the pad
   4) assemble it all
   5) programm that thing

Parts list for the numpad:
  1) ESP32 custom low power devboard
  2) brown tactile switches + lube, support switches
  3) custom PCB
  4) zenner diodes for hardware anti-ghosting
  5) battery and its charging circuit, using ESP32's USB input for charging
  6) (potentially) LED ARGB diodes for backlight
  7) numpad keycaps
  8) 3D printed case

The code - roadmap
  1) import libraries 
  2) define pins
  3) set up pinMode
  4) repeatedly set columns to high and read row values to detect change
  5) specify what each key press will do

 Idk what to write here anymore lol, this should do it 
 What do you think I've done today? Ofc nothing lol - Dave 23.02.25 23:22

15.03.2025:
  Coded a functional demo with one switch wired to esp8266. 
   - found a way to resolve unknown characters and garbage characters in serial monitor
   - programmable output to serial monitor after button press
16.03.2025
  Added code for confirmation LED diode
