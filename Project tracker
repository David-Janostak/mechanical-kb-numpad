My to do list:
 Learning stuff: 
   1) learn to use git in vsc - in progress
   2) learn the basics of C++ - not started yet
   3) make an example keyboard on a breadboard with switches, wires and an ESP32 - done
   4) programm that thing - in progress, currently paused (20.2.25)

 The numpad itself:
   1) choose parts and draw a schematic in EasyEDA
   2) order the pcb and the parts
   3) design and print a case for the pad
   4) assemble it all
   5) programm that thing

Parts list for the numpad:
  1) ESP32 custom low power devboard
  2) brown tactile switches + lube, support switches
  3) custom PCB
  4) zenner diodes for hardware anti-ghosting
  5) battery and its charging circuit, using ESP32's USB input for charging
  6) (potentially) LED ARGB diodes for backlight
  7) numpad keycaps
  8) 3D printed case

The code - roadmap
  1) import libraries 
  2) define pins
  3) set up pinMode
  4) repeatedly set columns to high and read row values to detect change
  5) specify what each key press will do

 Idk what to write here anymore lol, this should do it 
 What do you think I've done today? Ofc nothing lol - Dave 23.02.25 23:22

15.03.2025:
  Coded a functional demo with one switch wired to esp8266. 
   - found a way to resolve unknown characters and garbage characters in serial monitor
			- properly defined and set up communication between esp and pc (monitor_speed and monitor_filter in platformio.ini file), specified communication speed in void.setup in main.cpp
   - programmable output to serial monitor after button press
16.03.2025:
  Added code for confirmation LED diode
18.03.2025:
  - Extended ReadMe.md, specified my achievements so far and my plans for the future
  - Started working on PC to ESP32 communication and debugging the months old code
19.03.2025:
	- Started researching hardware for the final version
		- Will replace the esp32 with Seeed XAIO nRF52840 microcontroller, for the battery I'll use a 603048 900mAh 3.7V protected battery, for hardware antighosting I'll use 1N4148 diodes, the switches will be lubed brown K Pro by Keychron and I'll consider adding RGB diodes WS2812B SMD 5050
		- The PCB will be custom designed and the case 3D printed. I've not researched the keycaps yet.

30.07.2025:
  - In the last 4 months, I was trying to create a wiring diagram and design the pcb so that I can buy all the parts and put them together. 
   - I wasn't sure that the diagram is drawn correctly, therefore was unable to design the pcb itself.

   - My plan:
    1. Buy all the parts
    2. assemble everything on a breadboard
    3. write the code
    4. proove that my wiring diagram works
    5. adjust the diagram if needed
    6. design and order the pcb
    7. design and 3D print the case

   - I've decided to use Keychron K PRO *mint* switches instead of the brown ones
    - size of the matrix will be 4x6 

  (remaining) PARTS LIST:
   ###- 1x seeed xiao nRf52840
   ###- 1x 603048 900mAh 3.7V protected battery
   ###- 21x (25x) 1N4148 diodes
   ###- 21x Keychron K pro Mint switch
   ###- 24x (30x) WS2812B SMD 5050 V5
   ###- 24x (30x) 0,1uF capacitor 
   ###- 1x 330ohm resistor
   - 6x wide keycap stabilizer

   - keycaps - 3D printed
   - case - 3D printed

20.8.2025:
  - excluding wide keycap stabilizers, all parts ordered
