# Mechanical keyboard Numpad

This repo features not only the final project but also my prototypes, trials, errors, and smaller projects based on ESP32 and ESP8266 dev modules. These smaller projects helped me build and test specific functions and features of the final version.

As of this writing (18.03.25), I have completed one entire prototype based on the ESP8266. Assembled the hardware, programmed and debugged communication between the ESP and PC via the serial monitor. You can find the relevant code in the main.cpp and platformio.ini files.

A second prototype is already on its way (as of 18.03.25), hardware is assembled and some basic code runs on the ESP too, no propper communication is set up tho. Parameter-wise this prototype features ESP32 WROOM dev module and wiring with a 2x3 button matrix. The main challenge for this prototype is to recognise each button separately and to make it work seamlessly with just 6 buttons.
